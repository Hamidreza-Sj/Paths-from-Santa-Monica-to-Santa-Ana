# Traffic Flow Modeling and Analysis in the Los Angeles Highway System
In this repository, explores traffic flow optimization on a Los Angeles highway network. It calculates the shortest path, maximum flow, and social optimum, solving for Wardrop equilibria and toll-based optimizations. The project utilizes .mat files for network data and employs cvxpy for optimization tasks.
